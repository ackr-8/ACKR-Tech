# What are Desktop Environments

Desktop environment or DE in a nut shell is a GUI for your distro, it also provides functions to control the system and more.

In Linux there are multiple DEs to choose from. Here are the major ones :

### KDE Plasma
Arguably the most customizable and functional DE available. Plasma can be tweaked to your hearts content and has a very familiar look to Windows. Its has tons of customizations for power users and ricers alike.

### GNOME
A relatively heavy yet minimal DE for minimalists and certainly a eyecandy. GNOME is also customisable with various extensions to choose from and also the UI is very touch friendly if thats what you are looking for.

### Xfce
A fork of GNOME 2 to provide a fast and lightweight experience. Very good customization support.

### Deepin
A minimalist DE with a lot of polish and believes in good out of the box experience. Its relatively new and has some hiccups here and there.

### MATE
Mate strives to provide a good user experience coupled with the legacy of GNOME 2.

### LXQt (Previously LXDE)
A very lightweight DE primarily for entry level or older computers.

All of the DEs have their pros and cons and I suggest you to choose yourself rather than on asking someone as every user's needs are different.
